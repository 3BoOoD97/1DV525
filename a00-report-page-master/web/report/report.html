<h2>Part 00 - A00</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Describe your computer development environment, what OS, what terminal you are using, how you are using Git (through terminal or GUI), what texteditor/IDE you work in and if you have any plugins you like</p>
<br>
I am using Windows, I am using PowerShell terminal inside my IDE Visual Studio Code and I am using Git through terminal.
I am using Live Server plugin wich helps to see the result on the browser.     

<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub/GitLab and/or Markdown?</p>
<br>
Yes, I did use Github during my first study year. I did a Hangman project in a course, and I worked with a group in another course, so we used it.<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Have you ever created websites before?</p>
<br>
Yes, in my first study year, we created a website as a group of seven students. It was an online store—basically HTML and CSS and JS and Firebase.

<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
<br>
I know the basics, like creating a button or moving between the pages using the navbar or how to change the background or how to change the font size, family, color. 

<br>
<br>
<p class="question">What is your TIL for this course part?</p>
<br>
Good start so far.

<h2>Part 01 - A01</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Did you know and had used HTML and CSS before this assignment? </p>
<br>
Yes, during my first year, I used HTML and CSS when I was working on a project we created an online store, so we used both of them.

<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Brifly exaplain, with your own words, about HTML to a person who have never heard of it before.</p>
<br>
It is not a programming language, but it is a language or a method for describing the contents of a web page to browsers,  like texts, images, etc.


<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Brifly exaplain, with your own words, about CSS to a person who have never heard of it before.</p>
<br>
It is a descriptive language that gives the website a beautiful look and unique design that will distinguish it from other websites. CSS is always being used with HTML. 

<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Did yElaborate on the importance of keeping HTML (markup and content) and CSS (style and layout) as two separate items. Is it important and in that case why? Can it be completely separated or do they smoehow depend on eachother? </p>
<br>
It is important to separate HTML and CSS in different files, so if we want to modify the design, we know where we have to modify and if we want to modify the content, we know where we have to modify. HTML and CSS depend on eachother. Each of these two languages ​​forms the basis for every website.

<br>
<br>
<p class="question">What is your first impression of JavaScript as a programming language? </p>
<br>
I find it messy somehow. I am used to having classes and to use data types like int, string, etc. 


<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Can you compare JavaScript as a programming language with other languages you know. Do you see equalities and differences?</p>
<br>
Comparing Javascript with Java or other programming language, I can say Javascript is much easier. For example in Java, I need to declare the data tybe like string, int, char... But in Javascript, no need for that since var is enough. 


<br>
<br>
<p class="question">What is your opinion about the popularity of JavaScript? Can you see why it became popular or do you think that its popularity is overestimated? In your humble opinion?</p>
<br>
I believe JavaScript deserves to be popular since it is considered a relatively easy language to learn and close to the English language, and it is Interactive and fast.

<br>
<br>
<p class="question">Describe how you opted to organize your JavaScript code in the assignment.</p>
<br>
I divided my code into functions. Each function does a specific task, then I have linked it with the HTML using .getElementById.


<br>
<br>
<p class="question">What is your TIL for this course part? </p>
<br>
I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, and other things that are new to me, like how to insert an image and manipulate it and how to make tables. and the basics of JS like functions. So it was useful.
</section>







<section>
<h2>Part 02 - A02</h2>

<p class="question">Explain how the scope works in JavaScript, how hoisting affects it and how a closure works. </p>

How the Scope works?
There are two scopes in JavaScript global and local. Global scoop means any variable declared outside of a function, and it is accessible from anywhere.  Local scoop means any variable declared inside of a function and it is accessible from that function.

How Hoisting affects Scoop? 
Functions, when declared with a function declaration, are always hoisted to the top of the current scope

How closure works?
Closure means When we create a function inside another function the inner function is the closure. This closure is returned so we can use the outer function's variables later.






<p class="question">What are your thoughs on the module design pattern and the prototype object model? </p>

Module Design Pattern:-
We divide our program into small parts (modules). This pattern is useful in encapsulation and data hiding. Moreover, it is very useful in development and maintenance and Code reuse.

Prototype Object Model:-
When we create any prototype belongs to an object, we can manipulate that prototype. We can also create our own prototype attach this prototype to any object we want. 


<p class="question">Describe how you opted to organise your JavaScript code in the assignment and your observations and learnings from your code structure.</p>

I divided my code into classes and functions. Each class responsible for one thing, for example, the class Quizz.js responsible for Get and Fetch the data from the server, and the Class User.js responsible for the user like the user nickname, age.
Following this approach will help me to detect any problems that occur. 

<p class="question"> How do you feel about asynchronous programming in JavaScript, can you relate it to some other programming you done previously?</p>

Async function does not obstruct the program when it is running, this function returns a promise, and this promise can be resolved or rejected, but in any case, it will return something.
Async function always has await expression inside it, which is easier to use than Timer.
I have not used Async  previously, I believe we took it in the Introduction to Web Programming Course, but I didn't take this. course 


<p class="question"> Elaborate on the lint (test) and build sequence of your code. Do you see pros and cons and can you relate it other development work you have done?</p>

Lint helps us to make sure that our code is readable and easier to maintain.
Lint helped me to format my CSS code since there were a lot of unnecessary spaces and commas. In general, it helped to format my code and clean it. 
I couldn't see any cons.

<p class="question"> What is your TIL for this course part?</p>
In this part, I learned some concepts like Scoop, Hosting, Linters, Minifiers.
But unfortunately, this part does not describe concepts like Promises, Get(), Fetch().

<section>
<h2>Part 03 - A03</h2>
<p class="question"> For each feature (F1, F2 and so on) you have implemented, write a 5-10 sentences text about it and let the teacher know how you solved it. This is essential. There is no grade if you fail to write about the features.</p>


F1:
I made a class called dragNdrop the constructor of this class takes container as a parameter and inside the constructor, I added three EventListeners to move the window up and down and to update the window coordinates, I have also document.querySelectorAll to returns all elements in the document that matches a specified CSS selector(s), as a static NodeList object.
I have also EventListener('click'...) to close the window if the user clicks on the X button. 

F2:
I have commented on my code using JSDoc, to explain what each function does.
For linters, I had many errors in my CSS file I have tried the '--fix' command to solve them but it shows me the error "Missing expression after unary operator '--'" so I solved all the errors manually.


F3: I have created a class called memory with some functions such as createGame() which creates an image for each card and adding an event listener('click') so if any card clicked it will go to showCard() which shows the clicked card and it will compare if the clicked card = the previous clicked card or not, if yes it will keep the two cards shown if not it will hide them again. shuffleCards(x,y) which returns an array of numbers  will shuffle the cards randomly based on the x and y (columns and rows) 


F4:
I have created a class called chat, I have initialized a new WebSocket using the given WebSocket, and I used localStorage to get the saved user name.
 I have EventListener('keypress' ) if the user types a message in the Text box and then press Enter it will take this Text box value with the user name and with the key that given in the assignment, in one var then after that, it will convert that var to string before sending it to the server using JSON.stringify(), after converting completes it means we can send the data to the server using socket.send(). I have a function called displayMessages(event) which displays the messages from the server after it converts them into a JavaScript object using JSON.parse(). 
I have a function called addUserName() which takes the user name from the user and save it, and if the user already entered a name it  the button will be changed from Add Username to Change Username, so the user can change the name.


F5: I have created a class called hangMan, I have created an array that contains all the word and var that chooses one of them randomly, after choosing a word, I created createTextNode(this.underScore()) and appendChild to display this.underScore(). this.underScore()  display the chosen word as underscores, I have ansText to take the char from the user and I have added EventListener('keypress') if the user types a char and then pressed Enter it will take this char and go to checkChar() which check if this char exist in the chosen word. 

<p class="question">Write a concluding text, 5-10 sentences, about your implementation of the project. Write about hard/easy, troubles/solutions, and so on, things you encountered and thought of during the project and its implementation.</p>

Doing the windows was the hardest part since it is something new and it needs good logic and some math.
Memory game was also too hard especially shuffling the cards, very good logic and math needed.
Chat was not that hard since I have basic idea about the sockets and communication.
HangMan was also not hard since I have done it in the previous assignment, the only difference here is updating the TextNode to display this char position when the user enters a right char. 

It was impossible for me to do this assignment, but the code in the example repo helped me somehow in some parts.  

<p class="question">What is your TIL for this course part?</p>
Extremely hard and complicated and it requires a lot of work and it time-consuming, slides and tutoring videos are not helpful. 

<p class="question">Write a final summary of your thoughts of this course. Did you enjoy it or not, did you learn anything/something/a lot. Let the teacher know your thoughts of the course and grade it by a scale 1-10 where 10 is "quite good course" and 1 is "not so good".</p>
I will give this course 4 because there is no balance in this course, for example if I will give chose the difficulty level for the assignments it will be like this: A1 between 1 and 2, A2 between 2 and 4, A3 between 7 and 9, jumping from basic level to advanced without passing the intermediate level is always fruitless. I know that A3 worth 3.5 credits but there is no reason to make it that complicated that much. 

<p class="question">What is your overall TIL for this course?</p>
First two assignments were very good I really learned a lot, it was very interesting assignments, however, I don't have a positive reflection on A3, all what I know is that I had to drop out of two courses to finish this assignment and it has some requirements that you don't know how to do, and even if you searched on the net you will find nothing like playing the memory game using only the keyboard.
